Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

##documentation:
step1: first of all I compared logistic and nearest neighbour accuracy 
step2: then I imported libraries
step 3: then I imported dataset
step4: then I checked the data information there were no null values
step 5: then I analysed the shape of data that how many rows are there or how many colomns so there were 768 rows and 9 coloumn
step 6:then I checked the heat map
step 7: then I crecked outlets and droped them
step 8:then I created visiulization 
the visualization that I created are listed below
1 DIST PLOT
2 SCATTER PLOT
3 COUNT PLOT
4 PAIR PLOT
step 9: then I did trining and testing of data
step 10: then I did data splitting
step 11: then I did comparision
step 12: then I used logistic regression to check the accuracy 
and the accuracy was 79%
step 13: then I used nearest neighbour to check the accuracy 
and the accuracy was 74%
conclusion :
FOR DIABETES PREDICTION LOGISTIC REGRESSION WORKS MORE ACCURATLY IN COMPARISION TO NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
